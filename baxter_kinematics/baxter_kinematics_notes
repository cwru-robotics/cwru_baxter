baxter kinematics notes:
at home pose, arms are outstretched, w/ 90-deg included angle.

from home pose, elbow-bend axis is "lower" (less z) than humerus rotation axis;
 positive elbow bend corresponds to lowering hand;
 elbow can bend positive, but not (or hardly) negative

kin dev notes:  fwd kin:
  fwd_kin code agrees with tf for shoulder point and elbow point, at home pose, w/rt right_upper_shoulder frame
  (w/ const double DH_q_offset2 = M_PI/2.0;)

elbow point is origin of right_lower_elbow frame;
wrist point is origin of right_lower_forearm frame;

NEED TO FIX: right_arm_mount is stationary, but right_upper_shoulder moves with S0;
ALSO, find transform from torso to right_arm_mount (static)
tf: right_upper_shoulder w/rt right_arm_mount: x,y, z = 0.055695, 0.000000, 0.011038
tf: right_arm_mount w/rt torso: x,y, z = 0.024645, -0.219645, 0.118588

---5/27: added correction for right-arm mount frame; got agreement w/ fwd_kin of right arm
   and tf w/rt "right_arm_mount" frame

---start IK (right arm)---
  for redundancy, use fnc for which specify q0, then find N solns for q1 through q6
   Do NOT expect elbow-up vs elbow-down solns (elbow bends one way); only allow positive elbow angles

  sub-soln: express desired wrist-point coords w/rt 1-frame
            find soln q1, q2, q3 that positions the wrist point
	    use APPROX model, since  DH_a5=0.01; (ignore this offset from forearm axis to wrist point)
            then iterate w/ J for exact solns

w_w/rt arm mount from IK:  0.303178  0.542953 -0.150389
tf: wrist x,y, z = 0.303188, 0.542965, -0.150332

fwd kin shoulder point: 0.0929757, 0.0580616, 0.281338
 tf: shoulder x,y, z = 0.092976, 0.058062, 0.281388

if set q(1)=0, transforms work (for all values of q(i) except q(1)!=0).
explanation:  URDF frame right_lower_shoulder ROTATES qith q(1).  oops

------------- solving for elbow angle------------
There is an IK singularity for elbow angles less than +0.22; (r_goal> 0.745)
 because of elbow-joint offset, can have 2 reachable solutions for r_goal> 0.745
 approx as: rqr r_goal< 0.745, --> q_elbow > 0.24
 choose the first elbow solution (q>0.24)

----5/28: MIGHT have q_s1, q_humerus, q_elbow IK working;
   need to test, and need to look for multiple solutions.
   I think there is only 1 valid q_elbow and (given q_elbow, q_humerus) only 1 valid q_s1;
   BUT...looks like there are 2 q_humerus solutions (and corresponding q_s1 solns)
   So...3DOF sys has 2 valid solns?  

---5/29: wrote compute_q123_solns()
  seems to be correct (within spherical-wrist approx)
  next, write 3DOF Jacobian to take approx soln to exact

--wrote get_wrist_Jacobian_3x3()
  computes influence of q_s1, q_humerus, q_elbow on wrist point, expressed in frame1 coords
  seems to be working (wrote test main)

-- added soln for spherical wrist--looks pretty good; needs more testing

--next, write code for sampling of q_s0, and get list of all 7-DOF solns

....did search over q_s0; found approx q_s0_ctr; searched dq_s0 to max, then dq_s0 to min;
   (only for q0 through q4 for wrist pt);
   commanded these to robot to visualize--looks OK
   still need to combine with wrist solns, and to list ALL solns in a vector (then plan motion through options)
   tried testing wrist solns--needs fixing

--wrote fnc: 
/major fnc: samples values of q_s0 at resolution DQS0 to compute a vector of viable, approximate solutions to IK of desired_hand_pose
// for solutions of interest, can subsequently refine the precision of these with precise_soln_q123, etc.
int Baxter_IK_solver::ik_solve_approx(Eigen::Affine3d const& desired_hand_pose,std::vector<Vectorq7x1> &q_solns)

tested this w/ test_main3; commands each of the solns;
  got ~100 solns w/ dqs0= 0.05 (all for the same desired tool pose)

--wrote fnc:
//function to find precise values of joint angles q1, q2, q3 to match desired wrist position, implied by desired_hand_pose
//provide q123_approx; this function will take q_s0 and q_forearm as specified, and q_s1, q_humerus and q_elbow as approximated,
// and will refine q_s1, q_humerus and q_elbow to attempt a precise fit to desired wrist position;
// improved soln is returned in q123_precise
double  Baxter_IK_solver::precise_soln_q123(Eigen::Affine3d const& desired_hand_pose,Vectorq7x1 q123_approx, Vectorq7x1 q123_precise) {

tested this with baxter_kinematics_test_Jacobian_main.cpp

--reconcile xform w/rt torso frame:
created fnc: fwd_kin_solve_wrt_torso(q_vec);
agrees w/ tf; looks good

---next: bring over stagecoach_planning fnc;

--started creation of cwru_joint_space_planner; seem to have successfully compiled; need to give it a try

--6/1: added ik_solve_approx_wrt_torso_given_qs0(0),
   fixed bug in precise_soln_q123()
   added update_spherical_wrist();
  to iterate for a precise soln, do this:
   1) solve q123 (approx)
   2) for each of above, solve q456;  there are now up to 4 solns
   3) for each of the above, do precise_soln_q123, followed by update_spherical_wrist()
For step 3, need an entire 7dof approx soln to proceed, since rotation of forearm affects q123 precise soln,
  and precise soln affects q456 of wrist;

-- added: improve_7dof_soln(Affine_flange_wrt_arm_mount, q_approx, q_7dof_precise);
  combines precise_soln_q123() and update_spherical_wrist()
  given an approx 7dof soln, finds the corresponding 7dof precise soln
  (tested in main3)

--created new package: baxter_traj_streamer, w/ library (class)
does:
  void Baxter_traj_streamer::stuff_trajectory( std::vector<Vectorq7x1> qvecs, trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory &new_trajectory) {
 and:
  void Baxter_traj_streamer::pub_right_arm_trajectory(trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory &new_trajectory)

If one creates a trajectory as a vector of Vectorq7x1, stuff_trajectory converts this into a "trajectory"
format and assigns reasonable time checkpoints

pub_right_arm_trajectory() publishes a trajectory to topic right_arm_joint_path_command

Need another node that receives trajectories and streams them out to Baxter with assigned timing

wrote baxter_traj_interpolator_node shell: subscribes to and receives trajectories, 
  needs to execute them with proper interpolation/timing
  written and compiles--but needs testing/debugging

to run, 
  start gazebo (and enable robot)
  start some trajectory computation node, e.g. baxter_traj_streamer_test_main (creates and publishes trajectory messages)
  start baxter_traj_interpolator_node (receives trajectory messages and interpolates motion commands at 100Hz)

interpolator node may be OK;  plotted with:
/robot/limb/right/joint_command/command[6] (etc) from rqt_plot

6/2: started baxter_traj_streamer/src/elbow_orbit_plan_main.cpp,
   which includes libraries:
#include <joint_space_planner.h>  (should put this one in subdir, to be consistent)
#include <baxter_kinematics/baxter_kinematics.h>
#include <baxter_traj_streamer/baxter_traj_streamer.h>
got this to compile--but still need to develop the logic.  Want to:
*construct "layers" consisting of IK solns at each index value of q_s0
*assemble layers into a "path_options" vector;
*invoke planner/solver to get "optimal_path";
*convert "optimal_path" to a "trajectory" (with timing)
*publish this trajectory to get streamer node to execute it
