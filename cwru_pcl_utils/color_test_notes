Issues:

from selected points, does:
  fit these to a plane
  return the plane normal, offset and centroid of patch selection
  
  In example code, the selected points are transformed to torso frame, so expect normal points +z
  
  cwru_pcl_utils_color_test.cpp:
  
  in loop, if get new selection of points:
    *transform these points to torso frame
    *fit these points to plane and return plane_normal, plane_dist and get centroid (all in torso frame)
    
    *use:   cwru_pcl_utils.filter_cloud_z(plane_dist, z_eps, radius,centroid,selected_indices);
      to get INDICES of points within +/- z_eps of z=plane_dist AND within "radius" of "centroid"
      
      
    *use:  cwru_pcl_utils.copy_indexed_pts_to_output_cloud(selected_indices,display_color_cloud); 
      to create a pointcloud of type XYZRGB, selected from the original (full) Kinect XYZRGB cloud,
      using "selecte_indices".  Note that although these indices were found based on transformed cloud,
      they corespond to points in original cloud
      
    *use:  avg_color = cwru_pcl_utils.find_avg_color_selected_pts(selected_indices);
       which consults the original Kinect cloud (in kinect frame) get get and average the color of
       a disk of radius "radius" about the patch centroid and coplanar with the patch.
       I.e., find to color of the patch. (Although the published selected points are colorless)
